## What Is SuperFinz?

SuperFinz is a full-stack personal finance web application designed specifically for Indian students and young professionals. It combines real-time expense tracking, AI-powered spend analysis, retirement planning, investment calculators, a GitHub-style spending heatmap, and a financial education hub — all in a single, mobile-first dashboard.

Built entirely in **36 hours** for **Vashisht 3.0**, the national-level technical fest at **IIITDM Kancheepuram**.

---

## Problem Statement

Gen Z Indians are entering the workforce or managing pocket money with zero financial literacy tooling built *for them*. Existing apps are either too complex (Zerodha, ET Money) or too generic (Splitwise). The result:

- Students spend 60–80% of their allowance on food delivery in the first 2 weeks of the month
- Most people aged 18–25 have no savings goal, no SIP, and no retirement projection
- Nobody knows what their ₹350 biryani habit actually costs over 25 years

**SuperFinz makes the invisible visible — in a language Gen Z actually speaks.**

---

## Core Features

### 1. Smart Onboarding

A 4-step adaptive onboarding wizard that tailors the entire app experience to the user's financial profile:

- **Step 1 — Identity:** Age and user type (School Student / College Student / Working Professional)
- **Step 2 — Financial Details:** Conditionally renders student fields (institution, monthly allowance, income sources: Parents / Scholarship / Part-time) or professional fields (company, salary, industry)
- **Step 3 — Spending Habit:** User selects their natural spending pattern — `FRONT_HEAVY` (month-start spender), `BALANCED`, or `CONSERVATIVE` (month-end spender). This directly drives the intelligent weekly budget allocation algorithm on the dashboard.
- **Step 4 — Set Limits:** Monthly budget + savings goal, with auto-budget fill (`budget = income − savingsGoal`) and a live **Monthly Money Plan** validation card that prevents impossible plans (budget + savings > income).

On completion, `onboarded: true` is set and the session is refreshed. Auth middleware redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` and unboarded users to `/onboarding` before they can access the dashboard.

---

### 2. Main Dashboard

A **server-rendered** overview page — all computations happen on the server, no client-side data fetching, no loading spinners.

**Financial Month Boundary:** Starts from the user's join date if they joined in the current calendar month. From the second month onward, it starts on day 1.

**Weekly Budget Pacing Algorithm:**
Months are split into 5 strict week slots (W1: days 1–7, W2: 8–14, W3: 15–21, W4: 22–28, W5: 29–end). Budget is distributed by spending-pattern weights:

| Pattern | W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 | W5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FRONT_HEAVY | 1.5× | 1.2× | 1.0× | 0.8× | 0.5× |
| BALANCED | 1.0× | 1.0× | 1.0× | 1.0× | 1.0× |
| CONSERVATIVE | 0.5× | 0.8× | 1.0× | 1.2× | 1.5× |

W5 weight is scaled by `(daysInMonth − 28) / 7` to correctly handle 28-day Februaries and 30-day months.

**Auto-Save Calculation:**
- `autoSaveMonth` = Σ `max(weekBudget_i − weekSpend_i, 0)` for all *completed* weeks only
- `autoSaveWeek` = `max(lastCompletedWeekBudget − lastCompletedWeekSpend, 0)`, zero until a full week is completed

**Retirement Readiness Score (0–100):**
```
fireCorpus    = monthlyBudget × 12 × 25            // 4% rule corpus
projCorpus    = monthlySip × ((1+r)^n − 1) / r     // SIP future value at 12% CAGR
corpusGapPct  = min(projCorpus / fireCorpus × 100, 100)
investPct     = min(monthlySip / income × 100, 100)

score = corpusGapPct × 0.50
      + min(investPct × 3, 100) × 0.30
      + min(investPct × 5, 100) × 0.20
```
- ≥ 70 → **On Track** (green) · 40–69 → **Needs Work** (amber) · < 40 → **At Risk** (red)

`fireDelayMonths = round(unnecessarySpend / monthlySip)` — how many retirement months are being lost to wasteful spending this month.

**Dashboard sections:**
1. Greeting + On Budget Pace badge
2. Retirement Readiness Score ring with 3 drivers (Invest %, Corpus Gap, FIRE Delay)
3. Smart Split Modal — auto-suggest distributing unspent budget to active goals
4. Money Spent / Money Saved widgets (weekly/monthly toggle with mini area charts)
5. 4 Stat Cards — Spent, Remaining, Savings Rate, Transaction Count
6. Insight Strip — Daily average, month projection, top category
7. Spending Trend chart (cumulative vs budget pace) + Category pie chart
8. Spending Heatmap — inline 3-month calendar with "View full →" link
9. Recent Spends — last 5 transactions with AI necessity flags
10. Savings Goals — top 3 active goals with progress bars

---

### 3. AI Spend Analysis (`/api/ai-check`)

Every transaction logged is immediately analysed by a two-tier system:

**Tier 1 — Rule Engine** (always runs first):
- Categories `Rent`, `Utilities`, `Health`, `Education`, `Transport` are always marked necessary
- If a budget exists: necessary when `usedPct ≤ 80%` AND fewer than 2 similar transactions in the past 7 days
- If no budget: necessary only on the first transaction in that category that week

**Tier 2 — Groq LLM** (fires when rule engine flags unnecessary):
- Calls **Groq API** → `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (max 80 tokens, temperature 0.8)
- Prompt includes: category context, 7-day spend history, budget utilisation %, Gen Z tone instructions
- If API call fails or key is absent: falls back to a rich pool of templated roasts per category (Food, Entertainment, Shopping, Transport), each with dynamic variables `{amount}`, `{prev}`, `{weekSpend}`, `{time}`

Result: each transaction gets `isNecessary: boolean` + `aiNote` — a one-liner roast or validation shown inline next to every transaction.

---

### 4. Finz — AI Financial Chat (`/api/chat`)

A floating chat panel powered by **Groq API** with full financial context injected into every conversation:

**Context injected in system prompt:**
- User profile (name, age, user type, income, monthly budget, savings goal, spending pattern)
- This month's spending by category vs limits (with over-limit flags)
- Last 30 transactions with relative date labels and necessity flags
- Active savings goals with progress percentages
- FIRE corpus calculation (target vs projected at current SIP rate)
- Today's date (so AI can give time-aware advice)

**Model cascade** (tries in order, 10s timeout each):
1. `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
2. `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
3. `gemma2-9b-it`
4. Smart local fallback (`smartFallback()`)

**Local fallback** is keyword-aware (food / shopping / budget / savings / goals) and generates context-aware replies from real transaction data — zero API calls, never fails silently.

**Quick starters:** "Should I buy biryani today?", "How is my spending this month?", "Where am I overspending?", "How much can I realistically save?"

Conversation history (last 10 messages) is sent with every request for multi-turn context.

---

### 5. Spending Heatmap

GitHub contribution graph–style calendar for 3 months of spending:

- 7-column Sunday-to-Saturday grid with month labels and day-of-week labels
- 5 amber intensity levels: surface → `amber-100` → `amber-200` → `amber-400` → `amber-600`
- Intensity = `ceil((dayAmount / maxDayAmount) × 4)`
- Hover tooltip: date, total spent that day, transaction count
- Stats bar: 3-month total spend, active spend days, average per active day
- Inline version embedded on main dashboard with "View full →" link
- Full-page dedicated view at `/dashboard/heatmap`
- Empty state with CTA when no transactions exist

---

### 6. Retirement Planner (`/dashboard/retirement`)

Interactive calculator with real-time projections and a live corpus growth chart:

```
inflatedExpenses = monthlyExpenses × 12 × (1 + inflation)^yearsLeft
fireCorpus       = inflatedExpenses × 25              // inflation-adjusted 4% rule target
projCorpus       = FV_existing + FV_SIP
sipNeeded        = (corpus − FV_existing) × r / ((1+r)^n − 1)
monthlyPassive   = projCorpus × 0.04 / 12             // 4% safe withdrawal rate
```

All inputs adjustable via sliders: current age, target retirement age, monthly SIP, monthly expenses, existing savings, expected return (6–18% CAGR), inflation (3–10%).

Gap plan: when off-track, shows exact SIP increase needed and converts it to concrete actions ("skip X food orders/month to cover it").

---

### 7. Investment Calculators (`/dashboard/calculators`)

Three calculators with live **Recharts** area/bar chart visualisations:

**SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)**
```
maturity = monthly × ((1+r)^n − 1) / r × (1+r)    // annuity due
r = annualRate / 1200,  n = years × 12
```

**Fixed Deposit** — quarterly compounding:
```
maturity = principal × (1 + rate/400)^(4 × years)
```

**EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment):**
```
EMI = P × r × (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n − 1)
r = annualRate / 1200,  n = years × 12
```

---

### 8. Financial Education Hub (`/dashboard/learn`)

**12 hand-written articles** across 4 categories — fully searchable and filterable:

| Category | Articles |
|---|---|
| Basics | Budgeting 101 (50/30/20 rule), Why Your Money Loses Value, The Magic of Compounding + Rule of 72, Emergency Fund First |
| Investing | What is a SIP?, What is NIFTY 50?, What is CAGR?, FD vs Stocks vs Mutual Funds |
| Retirement | What is FIRE?, The 4% Rule, Why Start Investing at 21 |
| Advanced | Asset Allocation |

Article pages are **server-rendered** (static, no client JS). Each ends with an "Apply in SuperFinz" action box.

**FinTip Tooltips:** 10 financial terms (SIP, CAGR, FIRE, NIFTY 50, corpus, 4% rule, inflation, compounding, index fund, 25x rule) have inline `?` buttons throughout the app — hover for a definition + link to the full article. Financial education embedded directly into the UX.

---

### 9. Goals Tracker + FIRE Calculator (`/dashboard/goals`)

- Create goals with title, target amount, optional deadline
- Quick-add: +₹500 / +₹1,000 / +₹5,000 per goal
- Mark as achieved
- **Smart Split Modal:** When budget is under-spent, auto-suggests distributing unallocated funds across active goals with a slider per goal
- **Embedded FIRE Calculator:** auto-fills from profile, computes corpus = `expenses × 12 × 25`, estimates retirement age at 12% CAGR
- "Add as savings goal" creates a Freedom Fund pre-filled with your FIRE corpus
- Quick-start suggestions for fresh accounts (Emergency Fund, New Laptop, Trip to Goa, Investment Corpus)

---

### 10. Finance News Feed (`/dashboard/news`)

- Proxies **newsdata.io** filtered for `finance+investing+money` in India, English, business category
- 30-minute Next.js cache revalidation (`next: { revalidate: 1800 }`)
- 6 colour-coded category tags: Banking, Markets, Fintech, Personal Finance, Gen Z Finance, Tax
- Full mock fallback (6 curated articles) when API key is absent — demo badge shown in mock mode

---

### 11. Transactions (`/dashboard/transactions`)

- Log a spend → immediately see AI verdict + Gen Z roast
- **Compound interest callout:** ₹350 today → ₹8.4L in 25 years at 12% CAGR (shown while typing the amount)
- Delete transactions
- AI notes shown inline per transaction (necessity flag + roast text)
- Empty state with "Log your first spend" CTA

### Auth Flow

```
User → "Continue with Google"
  ↓
NextAuth signIn callback
  → prisma.user.upsert by email (create or update googleId, avatar, name)
  ↓
NextAuth jwt callback (runs on every token refresh)
  → DB lookup by email → stores userId + onboarded in JWT payload
  ↓
NextAuth session callback
  → attaches userId + onboarded to session.user
  ↓
Server Components: getSession()
  → auth() from NextAuth + fresh DB lookup (email fallback for OAuth sub mismatch)
  ↓
proxy.ts (Next.js 16 Proxy Middleware — runs at edge, no DB call)
  → /dashboard/** : unauthenticated → /login?callbackUrl=...
  → /dashboard/** : not onboarded → /onboarding
  → /onboarding   : already onboarded → /dashboard
  → /api/**       : unauthenticated → 401 JSON
  → /login        : authenticated → /dashboard
```

---

### Prisma 7 + Supabase Connection Strategy

Prisma 7 moved config out of `schema.prisma` into `prisma.config.ts`. Two separate connection strings are required:

| Usage | URL | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime queries | `DATABASE_URL` | 6543 | pgBouncer pooler, `?pgbouncer=true`, used in `src/lib/prisma.ts` |
| Migrations / db push | `DIRECT_URL` | 5432 | Direct connection, used in `prisma.config.ts` |

This prevents connection pool exhaustion under serverless concurrency (Vercel) while keeping migration tooling functional.

---

### Mobile Navigation

The sidebar adapts across breakpoints:

- **Desktop (lg+):** Fixed left sidebar (208px), logo at top, full nav list, profile + sign-out at bottom
- **Mobile:** Fixed top bar (logo + avatar), fixed bottom bar showing 4 primary nav items (Overview, Transactions, Retirement, Goals) + **More** button
- **More drawer:** Slide-up sheet with remaining items (Learn, Calculators, News, Heatmap, Profile, Sign out) + backdrop dismiss
- All nav links close the drawer on navigation

## Key Design Decisions

**Server-first overview:** The main dashboard is a React Server Component. All financial calculations — retirement score, budget pacing, auto-save, heatmap aggregation, trend data, category breakdown — run on the server. Zero `useEffect`, no loading spinners, no hydration flicker.

**Spending pattern as a first-class concept:** Rather than dividing a monthly budget evenly by day, SuperFinz models how people actually spend. The pattern selected during onboarding drives weekly budget distribution throughout the month, making the numbers feel personal and accurate.

**Auto-save, not manual saving:** The "Money Saved" widget calculates savings automatically from under-budget completed weeks. The number feels earned, not entered.

**Education in context:** FinTip `?` tooltips appear inline next to unfamiliar terms like "corpus" and "FIRE delay" — not buried in a help section. Users learn financial vocabulary in the exact moment they encounter it.

**Full offline-capable fallbacks:** Every external API (Groq, newsdata.io) has a complete local fallback. The app is fully functional with zero API keys — critical for hackathon demos and resilience in production.

**Prisma 7 + pgBouncer split:** Runtime queries use the pooled URL (compatible with Vercel serverless concurrency). Migrations use the direct URL. This prevents connection pool exhaustion and is a non-obvious Prisma 7 requirement most tutorials don't cover.

**No dark mode:** The amber/yellow light theme was deliberately chosen to stand out in a sea of dark-mode fintech apps. Judges notice distinctive UI first. The palette is calm, warm, and readable — not clinical or aggressive.

**Mobile-first navigation:** The bottom nav exposes only the 4 most-used destinations. The "More" drawer prevents a cramped 8-item bottom bar while keeping every feature one tap away.

## Demo Talking Points

With the seeded account:

1. **Food overspend** — ₹3,765 spent vs ₹3,000 budget. AI chat: "should I buy biryani today?" → Finz sees the history and roasts accordingly
2. **Entertainment 2× over limit** — ₹2,147 vs ₹1,000 — shown in red on dashboard
3. **Compound interest reality check** — ₹350 biryani → ₹8.4L in 25 years at 12% CAGR (visible when logging a transaction)
4. **FIRE calculator** — at ₹2,500/month savings, retirement age is 67, not 45. FIRE delay shown in the retirement readiness banner
5. **Heatmap density** — 68 transactions over 90 days shows a visually rich heatmap with clear food-heavy weeks
6. **Goals progress** — MacBook 6%, Euro Trip 6%, Emergency Fund 40% — realistic in-progress state
